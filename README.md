# Streaming-Data-Management-and-Time-Series-Analysis

The project undertaken focuses on the analysis, study, and prediction of a high-frequency time series (data every 10 minutes) related to the energy consumption of a city in Morocco in 2017. Methods from three families, namely ARIMA, UCM, and Machine Learning, were employed in the project's implementation and evaluated using the MAE metric.

Objectives:
1. Predict power values every 10 minutes for the period from 01/12/2017 00:00:00 to 30/12/2017 23:50:00.
2. Utilize three different methods: an ARIMA model, a UCM model, and one from the Machine Learning family.
3. Select, through validation processes, the most promising algorithms, narrowing down the choice to the "best" three, one from each family.
The goodness or badness of a model was assessed using the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) metric, which mathematically represents the distance between the predicted and actual values.
